## Visual dashboard of the COVID-19 Pandemic


### A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted us to display some statistics. Specifically, we would like to present global data for the number of: Confirmed Cases, Deaths, Recoveries. To make it dynamic, we will provide a dropdown that allows the user to select a specific country to view statistics for.

### A link to your data set(s) and a screenshot of the metadata if it exists.
